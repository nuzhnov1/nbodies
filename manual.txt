NAME
    nbodies - Solves the problem of n-bodies by sequential and parallel methods.

SYNOPSIS
    nbodies [options] [<Input file>] [<Output file>]

DESCRIPTION
    Solves the problem of n-bodies by sequential and parallel methods.
    The Euler method is used as a solution method. OpenMP technology is used 
    for parallel computing.

    The program operates in three modes: if the input and output files are not
    specified, a text user interface is launched, if only the input file is
    specified, then the system is loaded from it and displayed on the screen
    (or to a file if the -f parameter with the file name is specified).
    If the input and output files are specified, then the system is loaded from
    the input file, solved in accordance with the specified options and saved
    to the specified file, if it is not, then it is created.

    By default, the system is solved in parallel mode. The value of the
    end time of the system simulation by default is 10, the modeling step 
    by default is 0.1.

OPTIONS
    -t <Float number> or --time=<Float number> or --time <Float number>
        Setting end time of modeling to specified value.
    
    -d <Float number> or --delta=<Float number> or --delta <Float number>
        Setting step of modeling to specified value.
    
    -s
        Using a single thread when modeling
    
    -m
        Using multiple threads in modeling
    
    -q
        Setting the "quiet" mode of the program. Do not output the systems
        themselves to the console or to a file.
    
    -f <Filename> or --file=<Filename> or --file <Filename>
        Setting the output of systems to the specified file.
    
    -h or --help
        Printing this manual
